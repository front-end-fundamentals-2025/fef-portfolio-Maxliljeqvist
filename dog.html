     <p>British artist Alison Friend’s oil paintings blend traditional portrait techniques—like those of the Old Masters—with contemporary whimsy, particularly capturing the human-like antics of cats and dogs. A fine art graduate from Nottingham Trent University, where she specialized in printmaking, Friend initially pursued a career illustrating children’s books. Her transition to oil painting, marked by her unique anthropomorphic portrayal of animals, has brought her widespread acclaim. Friend has exhibited across the U.K. and internationally; she had her first U.S. solo exhibition in 2024, at Harman Projects in Los Angeles.</p>
